Write a program that calculates how much money youâ€™ll end up with the invested
amount of money at a fixed interest rate, compounded yearly. Have the user furnish the
initial amount, the number of years, and the yearly interest rate in percent.
At the end of the first year you have 3000 + (3000 * 0.055), which is 3165. At the end
of the second year you have 3165 + (3165 * 0.055), which is 3339.08. Do this as many
times as there are years. A for loop makes the calculation easy.
